A simple distance converter that I made using the Tkinter Python module, and I converted to an executable file using the cx_Freeze Python module. If you are on Windows, nothing needs to be installed to run the distance converter. Simply head to the exe.win-amd64-3.6 directory and run DistanceConverter.exe
